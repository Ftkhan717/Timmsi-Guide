## Digital Property Coordinator:


* As the Digital Property Coordinator, my main responsibility is to ensure that all property-related issues are addressed promptly and efficiently. 
Based on the meeting notes, I have identified several tasks that need to be completed in a specific order.

* Create a Readme file for each property: This file should contain all the relevant information about the property, such as its location, size, age, and any special 
features or concerns. This will help to keep everyone on the same page and ensure that all property-related tasks are carried out efficiently.
Example:

* Create a Readme file for the United Home property and include all the relevant information.
* Coordinate with the construction worker to ensure that trees are planted in the right location: The construction worker needs to be informed about the design plan 
* and ensure that the trees are planted in the appropriate location.

### Example:

* Coordinate with the construction worker to ensure that the trees are planted according to the design plan.

* Consult with the fire department to identify any pipeline issues: The fire department should be consulted to identify any issues with the pipelines, and Hammad should 
be notified to fix them.

### Example:

* Contact the fire department and ask them to identify any pipeline issues that need to be addressed by Hammad.
Organize all the property-related issues into milestones: This will help to prioritize the tasks and ensure that they are completed in a logical and efficient order.
Example:

* Organize all the property-related issues into milestones and prioritize them based on urgency.
Respond to tenant complaints promptly: If a tenant complains about a broken kitchen, respond immediately and prioritize that task.
Example:

* If a tenant complains about a broken kitchen, leave all other work and prioritize that task.
* Use GitHub and Revet to communicate with stakeholders: Use GitHub and Revet to keep all stakeholders informed about the progress of the project and any issues that
  arise.

Example:

* Use GitHub and Revet to communicate with all stakeholders and keep them informed about the progress of the project.
